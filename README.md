## Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader [here](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0). I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click on Glyphs, then "Install".
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your GlyphsMultiplayer.dll into the Mods folder (Get this from the releases page [here](https://github.com/BuffYoda21/Glyphs-Multiplayer/releases).
4) Create a new text file at /GLYPHS/GLYPHS_Data/ named "ids" and paste all of the players you want to play with's 17 digit long Steam IDs on new lines (you can find this in your Steam profile's URL or when you launch this mod it will show your ID in the log). 
5) Run the game. You should see the MelonLoader log pop up and show the mod being loaded. When your friends launch the game their player should appear at their current location on the map in real time!
